API Endpoints
=============

- `GET /api/start`: Starts a new game
- `POST /api/hit`: Draws a card
- `POST /api/stand`: Ends the player's turn
- `POST /api/double`: Doubles the bet and draws one final card
- `POST /api/surrender`: Surrenders the hand

Each endpoint interacts with the game state, allowing players to control their actions during the game.
